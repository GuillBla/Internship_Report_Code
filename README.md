# Internship_Report_Code
Code of the 3 experimental setups tested

Each code needs to be executed on Google Colaboratory. 
The command lines to install the required package are written in each files and can be executed directly in the session. 
Because the computing time is long, I also added a script to prevent from the interruption of the Google Colab session.
