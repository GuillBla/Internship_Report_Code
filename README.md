# Internship Report Code
Code of the 3 experimental setups tested

Each code needs to be executed on Google Colaboratory. 
The command lines to install the required package are written in each files and can be executed directly in the session. 
Because the computing time is long, I also added a script to prevent from the interruption of the Google Colab session.

To execute the code, it is necessary to import the zip file of the dataset I was provided.
It contains images from 27 categories of topic.
Therefore, before execution, the zip file must be saved in a Google Drive. 
The access to this Google Drive will be requested at the beginning of the execution.
